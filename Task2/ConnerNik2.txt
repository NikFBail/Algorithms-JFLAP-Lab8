First we have to create a new final state has epsilon transitions arrows
pointing to it from the old final states.
We then collapse the transitions on q4 to q4 into one transition, 1+0
We then collapse the transitions on q3 to q3 into one transition, 1+0
We then need to remove all non-final, non-initial states.
These are q1, q2, q3, q4.
By removing q4, the following transitions are changed, and what they are changed to:
    From q0 to q1, transition is 0
    From q0 to q2, transition is 1
    From q1 to q1, transition is 1
    From q1 to q5, transition is epsilon
    From q2 to q2, transition is 0
    From q2 to q3, transition is q3
    From q2 to q5, transition is epsilon
    From q3 to q3, transition is 0+1
